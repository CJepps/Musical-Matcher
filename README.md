# Musical Matcher 

# User experience (UX)

## Strategy
---
The main requirement of this project was to create a memory card game that is fun, requires minimal explanation, and can be enjoyed by an audience of all ages. I anticipate that this game will appeal more to music lovers or people learning music, so I also wanted to include a small educational component to the game. 

## User Stories
### Business Goals
- The game needs to incorporate a home page that is visually appealing and straightforward to use. 
- The game needs to be fun to play and easy to understand from the first instance so that users continue to play. 
- The game needs to be fully reponsive on a range of screen resolutions so that a broader audience is reached; If the Game is difficult to play on a particular device then we may lose those users.
### User Goals
- I want to know what the website is offering me, with a clear and straightforward layout to enable navigation.
- I want to be able to start the game easiliy and be presented with instructions on how to play the game.
- I want feedback on how well i am doing in the game. 
- I want the option of different difficulty levels.
- I want the ability to enable / disable sounds.
- I want to contact the developer with any suggestions / feedback for the game.
