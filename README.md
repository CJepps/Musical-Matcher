# Musical Matcher 

# User experience (UX)

## Strategy
---
The main requirement of this project was to create a memory card game that is fun, requires minimal explanation, and can be enjoyed by an audience of all ages. I anticipate that this game will appeal more to music lovers or people learning music, so I also wanted to include a small educational component to the game. 

## User Stories
---
### Business Goals
- The game needs to incorporate a home page that is visually appealing and straightforward to use. 
- The game needs to be fun to play and easy to understand from the first instance so that users continue to play. 
- The game needs to be fully reponsive on a range of screen resolutions so that a broader audience is reached; If the Game is difficult to play on a particular device then we may lose those users.
### User Goals
- I want to know what the website is offering me, with a clear and straightforward layout to enable navigation.
- I want to be able to start the game easiliy and be presented with instructions on how to play the game.
- I want feedback on how well i am doing in the game. 
- I want the option of different difficulty levels.
- I want the ability to enable / disable sounds.
- I want to contact the developer with any suggestions / feedback for the game. 

## Scope
---
- Home page with logo, start button that presents instructions on how to play the game (Modal).
- A 
- A button that enables users to bring up a contact form to email me (EmailJS API)
- Separate Game page with blank cards laid out in a Grid. 
- A timer that is displayed to the user and starts counting down upon the first card being flipped.
- A reset button 

## Structure
---

### Design
- Color Palette - I've gone for a minimalist styling to complement the musical theme and simplicity of a keyboard. I will use a monochrome color design for the majority of the application and use red (#FF0000) and green (#00FF00) in the game to show correct/ incorrect pairs respectably.

- Typography - I will use the Tourney Font (Google fonts) to style the website icon. Montserrat will be used as the main font with Sans Serif as the fallback incase this does not load.
